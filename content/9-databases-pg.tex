\section{@databases/pg}
The \texttt{@databases/pg} package is developed by Lindsay Forbes, a prominent
contributor to the Node.js ecosystem with hundreds of published packages. The
package offers a simple interface for CRUD operations on individual tables in
TypeScript. The package's typed interface is derived from schema definitions in
interfaces, which can be automatically generated using the
\texttt{@databases/pg-schema-cli} package. However, the package lacks support
for table joining, making it suitable only for basic queries. Complex queries
require a combination of templated SQL and conditions written using module
functions with types.

Though not as feature-rich as a typical ORM, the package simplifies basic
querying more than a standard query builder. It is exported as an ES module and
was initially licensed under GPLv3 but is now published under the MIT License.
The \texttt{@databases} project supports multiple databases via modular drivers,
with official support for Postgres, MySQL, SQLite, and Expo/WebSQL. Postgres has
the most advanced support, with additional databases supported through modular
drivers.

The package has 517 stars on GitHub and 26,613 weekly downloads which makes it
the fourth least downloaded and the second least known on GitHub. The project is
actively developed and comprises numerous subpackages, with new databases being
added and bugs frequently addressed. The package depends solely on internal
modules or widely used packages, such as \texttt{assert-never} and
\texttt{cuid}, along with the \texttt{pg} driver as a dependency.

While the documentation quality could be better, offering basic information, a
quick-start guide, and examples, there is no inline documentation requiring
developers to consult the online documentation. Database migrations can be
managed and executed using the \texttt{@databases/pg-migrations} package,
supporting both .sql and .ts formats. However, no interface is provided for
TypeScript migrations, necessitating custom scripts, and no schema modification
methods are included in the package.

\texttt{@databases/pg} is a package that simplifies basic querying in TypeScript
by providing a straightforward interface for CRUD operations. Although it lacks
the extensive functionality of a traditional ORM, it offers compatibility with
multiple databases and has an active development community. However, the absence
of inline documentation and limited support for complex queries and migrations
may require developers to rely on additional resources and tools.
