\chapter{Individual packages}

In the following chapters, we will discuss each package in detail, highlighting
its essential characteristics and the results it produced when tested using the
custom-designed benchmarking framework. This comparative analysis will enable us
to evaluate the packages objectively and provide valuable insights for
developers seeking the most suitable ORM or query builder for their TypeScript
projects. The results for each package will be examined in the context of the
package, with a simplified summary at the end.

\section{Disqualified frameworks}

While originally included for analysis and experimentation, some frameworks were
not successfully implemented. This approach had to be taken as the packages were
found to be lacking in features required for inclusion, such as basic TypeScript
support, or execution under the testing environment was unattainable, usually
due to outdated code or dependencies or not functioning as described in the
documentation. We were unable to fix the issues. These packages are nonetheless
included with a basic description of their advertised features and the issues
for their exclusion for this comparison.
