\chapter{Individual packages}

In the following chapters, we will discuss each package in detail, highlighting
its essential characteristics and the results it produced when tested using the
custom-designed benchmarking framework. This comparative analysis will enable us
to evaluate the packages objectively and provide valuable insights for
developers seeking the most suitable ORM or query builder for their TypeScript
projects. The results for each package will be examined in the context of the
package, with a simplified summary at the end.
