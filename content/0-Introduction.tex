\chapter{Introduction}

In the modern world, data have become an essential aspect of almost every field. From e-commerce to healthcare, education to finance, data is everywhere and plays a critical role in decision-making processes. The advent of Web 2.0, which brought with it the concept of user-generated content, was largely supported by connecting the Web to databases. Social media platforms, for example, rely heavily on data to provide personalised recommendations, targeted advertising, and other features that keep users engaged. Even non-Web entities and applications often need significant data storage and, as a result, the ability to manage and manipulate data has become a critical skill for developers and organisations alike.\par
Relational databases such as SQL Server and PostgreSQL are by far the most popular databases for data storage used in business-level applications. These databases use the relational data model, which is based on tables with rows and columns, to store and manipulate data. However, there are also non-relational NoSQL alternatives like MongoDB and Firestore that use a document data model, key-value stores like Redis, or a graph data model (Neo4j) to manage data. Although these databases have their unique strengths and weaknesses, they are generally considered to be more flexible than relational databases and are particularly well-suited for managing unstructured data.\par
Object-oriented programming languages and languages incorporating parts of the paradigm, such as Java, Python, Ruby, and JavaScript, have gained popularity due to their ability to create complex software systems that can handle large amounts of data efficiently. Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that represents concepts as "objects" that have attributes (data) and behaviours (methods). This makes it easier to write, maintain, and reuse code, which is essential when working with large-scale software systems.\par
Despite the popularity of object-oriented programming languages, there is often a disparity between OOP languages and the relational data model used by many databases. OOP languages are designed to work with objects, whereas relational databases are designed to work with tables. This can make it challenging for developers to work with databases using OOP languages. \par
Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) has become a popular solution for developers who need to connect object-oriented programming languages with relational databases. ORM allows developers to work with relational databases using object-oriented programming languages, eliminating the need to write complex SQL queries. By abstracting away the details of the underlying database, ORM allows developers to focus on the application logic and reduces the amount of boilerplate code that needs to be written. This makes it easier for developers to work with databases and reduces the potential for errors. \par
The paper aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the most popular ORM packages and SQL query builders for Typescript. This analysis will provide an objective measurement of their relative strengths and weaknesses in terms of functionality, type support, performance, and package quality. Also included are noncomparative examples of syntax and usage to illustrate strengths and weaknesses and to showcase the functionality of the modules. By evaluating each package's performance in these key areas, the paper aims to provide a comprehensive comparison that will be useful to developers who are looking for the best ORM or SQL query builder package for their Typescript project.\par
Before we start with the full comparison of ORMs that support TypeScript, we must first define what counts as an Object-Relational Mapping Package, what are SQL Query Builders, and other technologies and terms used further in this work. Then we explain how the packages further analysed were selected and by which criteria they are ranked and reviewed.\par
