\subsection{Bookshelf.js}

Despite its last update occurring in July 2020 \cite{bookshelfNpm}, Bookshelf.js
remains a~popular database access package on npm, with 103,607 weekly downloads
at the time of writing this thesis. Started by Tim Grissier, who also initiated
the development of the query builder Knex, Bookshelf.js is an ORM which is based
on Knex and implements the Data Mapper pattern for entities in the database.
Designed to work with PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite3, Bookshelf.js has not been
actively developed for an extended period, resulting in compatibility issues
with more recent versions of Knex \cite{bookshelfGitHub}.

The last officially supported Knex version for Bookshelf.js was 0.21.17, whereas
the current Knex version is 2.4.2. This discrepancy has led to several type
errors and incompatibilities as the Knex API has evolved over time. While there
are forks of the repository that address significant issues, the package still
suffers from limited type support, primarily because the entire project is
developed in pure JavaScript, with types generated as an afterthought
\cite{bookshelfDocs}.

The primary reason for disqualifying Bookshelf.js from the comparison was the
numerous dependencies with unmaintained and outdated versions, which pose
significant security risks. These risks include prototype pollution
\cite{cve-2019-10744} and SQL injection attacks \cite{cve-2016-20018}, making
the package unsuitable for modern, secure applications. The package itself
cannot run unless these dependencies are installed or at least overridden.
